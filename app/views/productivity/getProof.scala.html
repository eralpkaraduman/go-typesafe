                <p>One of the strongest evangelists at discussing developer productivity is Yevgeniy (Jim) Brikman, the lead developer bringing the Play Framework to LinkedIn. Check out the talk he gave at JaxConf 2013 discussing how LinkedIn is using the Play Framework to build front-end and back-end services at massive scale. Forward the video to 43:34 to hear his interesting take on developer productivity.</p>

                <p>After seven years of PHP development, the team at Gawker Media started to bump into issues maintaining an unruly 300,000-line codebase that served content across eight original brands with a collective audience of tens of millions of US readers. Gawker Media made the move to consolidate their fragmented infrastructure under a JVM-based umbrella, and, in turn, consolidated their codebase to approximately 65,000 lines of Scala.</p>

                    <p>The Typesafe Reactive Platform helps us maintain a very aggressive development and deployment cycle, all in a fail-forward manner and now it is the default choice for all new services.</p>
