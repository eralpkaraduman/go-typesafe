                        <p>One of the strongest evangelists at discussing developer productivity is Yevgeniy (Jim) Brikman, the lead developer bringing the Play Framework and Scala to LinkedIn.</p> 
                        <p>The first part of the video discusses how LinkedIn is using our technologies build front-end and back-end services at massive scale. Forward the video to 43:34 to hear his interesting take on developer productivity. </p>

                        <p>After seven years of PHP development, the team at Gawker Media started to bump into issues maintaining an unruly 300,000-line codebase that served content across eight original brands with a collective audience of tens of millions of US readers. </p>
                        <p>Gawker Media made the move to consolidate their fragmented infrastructure under a JVM-based umbrella, and, in turn, consolidated their codebase to approximately 65,000 lines of Scala.</p>
