                        <p>When looking for ways to provide peers with proof, consider creating a casual knowledge sharing environment. That’s what Sr. Architect Joe Barnes did at Mentor Graphics. This video captures his introduction to functional programming in Scala and is filled with inspiring ideas to help jumpstart your presentation. </p>

                    <dd>
                        <p>Gilt was originally a Ruby on Rails application with a PostgreSQL backend in 2007. Gilt grew faster than anyone could have imagined and everyone was caught off guard by how difficult it was to scale the Rails stack. This article does a great job of describing Gilt’s historical transition from Rails to the Typesafe Reactive Platform.</p>

                    <dd>
                        <p>There are a ton of example case studies on our website that  discuss the benefits of moving from a monolithic code base to micro-services. The Guardian case study is a good fit if your company has a fairly conser if your enterprise company is currently using Java. Plus, it nicely weaves in the Java-to-Scala story.</p>

                        <p>John Pavley, CTO shares his perspectives on modernizing the infrastructure at the Huffington Post in this detailed engineering blog post.</p>
                        <p> While keeping things simple, safe, and reusable can be done in PHP it takes a tremendous amount of effort. Scala enforces humanistic coding by default. You can write bad code with Scala but you have to work hard to do it.</p>

                    <dd>
                        <p>This is a story about how Empathica as an organization transformed itself from being a Microsoft .NET shop to a Scala one. It didn’t happen overnight, and this is definitely not a how-to guide on how to achieve similar change somewhere else.  If you’re looking for a side by side comparison of Scala and C#/.NET, you won’t find it here.  This is just an account of how the change itself unfolded.</p>
