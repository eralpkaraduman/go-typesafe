                <p>Ticketfly crafted a powerful reserved seating engine (something that is notoriously complicated to build because of its rapidly changing state), that could scale easily, handle bursty and unpredictable traffic patterns and compete with online ticket scalpers.</p>
                <blockquote class="red">
                    <p>Clearly, the goal is to do these operations concurrently and non-blocking, so that entire blocks of seats or sections are not locked. Finding and allocating seats under load happens in less than 20ms. The system has very good performance without having to try very hard to achieve it.</p>

                <p>The move to these technologies is already paying off. Response times are down for processor intensive code - such as image and PDF generation â€“ by around 75%.</p>
