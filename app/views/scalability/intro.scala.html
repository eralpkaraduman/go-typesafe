    <li>The JVM is the foundation for mission critical apps that have to scale.</li>
    <li>Threads provide an efficient way to handle parallel tasks in a single server.</li>
    <li>Clustering with Akka and load balanced nodes with Play Framework provide a way to scale across servers.</li>
    <li>Akka's Actor model creates a safe and understandable way to manage concurrency.</li>
    <li>Scala (if you choose to use it) is built to scale with built-in features like immutability, parallel collections, and Promises &amp; Futures.</li>
